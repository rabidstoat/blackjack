 * <b>EXTRACREDIT</b>: This package provides the client-side support for the
 * extra credit problem of how to find a server to connect to without being
 * given a host. See the class files for more detail on how this is 
 * accomplished (though it's basically by multicasting a request to a specific
 * group and port, and then monitoring for any useful responses).

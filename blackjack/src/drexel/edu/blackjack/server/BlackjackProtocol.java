 * Purposes: This is the object that represents the protocol state of the
 * server-client connection. One protocol object exists for every client
 * connection. It holds stateful information such as which (DFA) state the
 * protocol is in, as well as attributes associated with the state, such as
 * which logged-in user is associated with it. Finally, it is the 'router'
 * for input from the client, passing it off to the appropriate implemented
 * command using the Command pattern.

/**
 * <b>STATEFUL:</b> Our protocol class is where we keep 
 * track of the protocol state, along with any stateful
 * variables. These variables include, for example, which 
 * user is authenticated in a particular instantiation of
 * the protocol. The user is initially null until they
 * authenticate. There are other local variables too, such
 * as the amount bet, or the number of incorrect login
 * attempts made.
 * <P>
 * <b>CONCURRENT:</b> Each thread has its own protocol
 * object for identifying the authenticated user.
 * <P>
 * All state information is kept associated with the
 * protocol object. When a command is called on the
 * protocol option, the command itself is stateless.
 * It just queries the protocol object it's passed for
 * the state. In this way, one instantiation of the
 * command option can handle an arbitrary number of
 * different protocols' commands.
 * <P>
 * Pretty much everything in this class has to do with
 * our requirement for being stateful.

 * <b>EXTRACREDIT</b>: This package provides the server-side support for the
 * extra credit problem of how to find a server to connect to without being
 * given a host. See the class files for more detail on how this is 
 * accomplished (though it's basically by monitoring a multicast UDP port
 * and responding to messages that are looking for a server with an appropriate
 * address).

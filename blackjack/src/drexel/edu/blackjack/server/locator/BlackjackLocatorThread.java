/**
 * EXTRACREDIT: We are running a locator service with a
 * thread that monitors the UDP port 55556, checking for
 * broadcast messages looking for a BJP 1.0 server. The
 * multicast group that should be used is defined in
 * {@link #MULTICAST_GROUP}. 
 * <p>
 * The basic algorithm is this: a multicast socket is
 * opened on the agreed upon port, and the multicast
 * group is joined. The server then loops through its
 * network interfaces to find multicast-capable addresses
 * that it is associated with; there are quite likely
 * multiple addresses on multiple subnets. It makes a
 * list of these, and their associated submasks, with
 * only IPv4 addresses currently handled.
 * <p>
 * Then it waits for messages. When it gets one, it sees
 * if it's a BJP address request. If so, it looks at the
 * address of the requester, to guess what the best
 * network address is to use, as it wants to give them
 * one on the same subnet if possible. It then responds
 * to the message by broadcasting, over the same port,
 * its location information.

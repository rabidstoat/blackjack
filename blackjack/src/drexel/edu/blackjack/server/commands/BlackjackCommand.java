 * Purpose: This is a base class which all classes that implement protocol
 * command functionality must extend. There is a one-to-one correspondence
 * between protocol commands, and classes that implement the functionality
 * related to the command. It mostly defines the methods that need to be
 * implemented by these command classes.

/**
 * Commands that the server interprets will implement this class.
 * 
 * These commands should keep track of no state. The state should
 * be derived from the BlackjackProtocol object. The commands will be shared
 * across multiple connections, so they just have the logic that
 * operate on parameters that are passed into them.

	 * The algorithm for all command states should look something
	 * like this (possibly incomplete):
	 * 
	 * 0. If either parameter is null, return an internal error
	 * response code
	 * 1. Check to see if in a state (get it from the protocol
	 * object) where this command is valid.
	 * 1a. If not, send the error response code (this is hopefully
	 * specified in our protocol spec, if not, need to figure
	 * out what the code should be)
	 * 2b. If it is in a correct protocol state, keep going
	 * 3. Make sure the syntax of the command is correct (e.g.,
	 * if it's the USERNAME command they MUST have a single
	 * parameter -- you can get parameters off the CommandMetadata
	 * object, getParameters() method)
	 * 4a. If not, send a response code (again, look in document,
	 * might be 502 Syntax Error code or might be something
	 * more specific)
	 * 5. Do whatever work needs to be done for the command
	 * 6. Save out any state variables (e.g., on the USERNAME
	 * command, use BlackjackProtocol.setUsername() to save
	 * the username)
	 * 7. Update any change of state using the setState()
	 * method on BlackjackProtocol (e.g., if you were in the
	 * WAITING_FOR_USERNAME state update the state to
	 * WAITING_FOR_PASSWORD)
	 * 8. Generate the proper response code sting and return
	 * it
	 * 
	 * 
	 * @param protocol The protocol connection that made that
	 * command. From there the user, state, and all sorts of
	 * good information can be found.
	 * @param cm Information derived from the client associated
	 * with the user, what it sent in to the server
	 * @return The string that should be sent back to the client
	 * as the response. Potentially multi-line.

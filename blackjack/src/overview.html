    <TITLE>Blackjack Client-Server Overview</TITLE>
  </HEAD>
  <BODY>
    This project contains a reference implementation for the Blackjack 1.0 protocol
    proposed for a CS544 class project. It includes both a basic server, and a simple
    command-line client.
    <p>
    As per assignment requirements, we have marked code that implements one of the
    five protocol requirements (STATEFUL, CONCURRENT, SERVICE, CLIENT, UI) in both
    class and method javadoc-style comments, but also at places in inline comments
    in the code. Comments are identified with the keyword in all caps. Classes
    that are involved in each of the requirements are linked below:
    <p>
    <OL>
    <LI><b>STATEFUL:</b> Follow the state transitions as per the DFA,
        checking and validating on client and server side as appropriate
